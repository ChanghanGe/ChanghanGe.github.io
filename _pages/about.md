Hi there! I am a third year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the [Wireless Networking and Communications Group (WNCG)](https://wncg.org/) of [The University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/), advised by [Prof. Lili Qiu](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~lili/). My research interests mainly lie in wireless networking and mobile computing. Before I entered UT, I received my Master of Science in Electrical Engineering (Communication Theory and Systems) from the [University of California San Diego (UCSD)](https://www.ucsd.edu/) in 2020, where I was fortunate to serve as a research assistant at the wireless networking group guided by [Prof. Xinyu Zhang](xyzhang.ucsd.edu). Prior to that, I received my Bachelor of Engineering with honor in Network Engineering from the [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC)](https://en.uestc.edu.cn/) in 2018. 

I was with [AT&T Labs](https://about.att.com/sites/labs) in Bedminster NJ for the summer of 2022 and 2023 as a research intern working on analytics and automation of next generation cellular network, where I was advised by [Dr. Ajay Mahimkar](https://sites.google.com/site/ajaymahimkar/) and Dr. Zihui Ge.
